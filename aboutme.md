Hi, my name is Tom. 
I am a 29 years old data enthusiast based in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. <br>
After working at auxmoney, one of Germany's largest FinTechs for some years, I now am a Data Scientist at Vodafone.<br>
I am enthusiastic about sports (esp. football and running), music and brewing beer - but also have a passion for AI and all things Data Science :) <br>
With this blog I want to save my learnings in a simple way so that, hopefully, it may help you too!

The main topics in this blog will be AI, but I will also write about other things I find interesting, such as general coding, mathematical problems among others.

Hope you enjoy some of my posts!

Cheers
Tom
