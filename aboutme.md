Hi, my name is Tom. 
I am a 29 years old data enthusiast based in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.
With this blog I want to save my learnings in a simple way so that, hopefully, it may help you too!

The main topics in this blog will be AI, but I will also write about other things I find interesting, such as general coding, mathematical problems among others.
